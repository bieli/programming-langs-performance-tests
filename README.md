# programming-langs-performance-tests
Most popular programming languages tests for various operations

## Motivation
One learning plaform to remember some older programming lenguages and teach modern, too.

Outputs: interesting facts/numbers about real programming languages performance to compare with TIOBE index programming languages popularity.

Assumptions: Winner on the market - i.e. in TIOBE programming languages - is not the most performant, but most simplistic to teach (have basic syntax)! 

## How to run?
Nothing complex here:

```bash
make all
```
